The Bank aims to expand its loan customer base by converting existing depositors into borrowers. A previous marketing campaign achieved a 9% success rate, encouraging the bank to refine its targeting strategy for better conversion rates at lower costs. The goal is to develop a predictive model to identify customers most likely to accept a personal loan offer.

Machine Learning Perspective
The dataset is supervised learning because it includes labeled data with a target variable (Personal Loan), indicating whether a customer accepted the loan offer.
Since we are predicting a categorical outcome (Yes/No), this is specifically a supervised classification problem.

Content:
This dataset includes customer demographics, financial attributes, and banking behaviors. Key columns:
Personal Loan: Target variable (whether a customer accepted the loan offer).
Demographics: Age, experience, family size, education level.
Financial Data: Income, mortgage, average credit card spending.
Banking Behavior: Securities and CD account ownership, internet banking usage, and credit card usage.

Type: Classification dataset for predictive modeling.

Algorithms 
Logistic Regression – A simple, interpretable model to establish a baseline.
Decision Tree – Captures non-linear relationships and interactions between features.
Random Forest – An ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) – Boosted tree-based models that provide high accuracy.
